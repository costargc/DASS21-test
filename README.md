# DASS21-test (Trivia Game take)

https://costargc.github.io/DASS21-test/

### Overview

The Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale - 21 Items (DASS-21) is a set of three self-report scales designed to
measure the emotional states of depression, anxiety and stress.

Each of the three DASS-21 scales contains 7 items, divided into subscales with similar content. The depression
scale assesses dysphoria, hopelessness, devaluation of life, self-deprecation, lack of interest / involvement,
anhedonia and inertia. The anxiety scale assesses autonomic arousal, skeletal muscle effects, situational
anxiety, and subjective experience of anxious affect. The stress scale is sensitive to levels of chronic nonspecific arousal. It assesses difficulty relaxing, nervous arousal, and being easily upset / agitated, irritable /
over-reactive and impatient. Scores for depression, anxiety and stress are calculated by summing the scores
for the relevant items.

The DASS-21 is based on a dimensional rather than a categorical conception of psychological disorder. The
assumption on which the DASS-21 development was based (and which was confirmed by the research data) is
that the differences between the depression, anxiety and the stress experienced by normal subjects and
clinical populations are essentially differences of degree. The DASS-21 therefore has no direct implications for
the allocation of patients to discrete diagnostic categories postulated in classificatory systems such as the
DSM and ICD.

Recommended cut-off scores for conventional severity labels (normal, moderate, severe) are as follows:
NB Scores on the DASS-21 will need to be multiplied by 2 to calculate the final score.

|               | Depression  | Anxiety | Stress |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| Normal  | 0+  | 0+  | 0+  |
| Mild  | 10+  | 8+  | 15+  |
| Moderate  | 14+  | 10+  | 19+  |
| Severe  | 21+  | 15+  | 26+  |
| Extreme  | 28+  | 20+  | 34+  |

### Commits

Having an active and healthy commit history on GitHub is important for your future job search. It is also extremely important for making sure your work is saved in your repository. If something breaks, committing often ensures you are able to go back to a working version of your code.

* Committing often is a signal to employers that you are actively working on your code and learning.

  * We use the mantra “commit early and often.”  This means that when you write code that works, add it and commit it!

  * Numerous commits allow you to see how your app is progressing and give you a point to revert to if anything goes wrong.

* Be clear and descriptive in your commit messaging.

  * When writing a commit message, avoid vague messages like "fixed." Be descriptive so that you and anyone else looking at your repository knows what happened with each commit.

* We would like you to have well over 200 commits by graduation, so commit early and often!

### Submission on BCS

* Please submit both the deployed Github.io link to your homework AND the link to the Github Repository!

### Before You Begin

1. Create a GitHub repo called `TriviaGame`, then clone the repo to your computer.

2. Create a file inside of the `TriviaGame` folder called `index.html`. This is where you'll mark up all of your HTML.
3. Don't forget to include a script tag with the jQuery library.

4. Create a folder inside of the `TriviaGame` folder called `assets`.
5. Inside `assets`, create three folders: `css`, `javascript`, `images`

   * In your `css` folder, create a `style.css` file.
   * In your `javascript` folder, create an `app.js` file; here you'll write all of your JavaScript and jQuery.
   * In your `images` folder, save whatever images you'd like to use in this exercise.

6. Choose a game to build from your options below. 

### Option One: Basic Quiz (Timed Form)

**[Click Here to Watch the Demo](https://youtu.be/fBIj8YsA9dk)**.

* You'll create a trivia form with multiple choice or true/false options (your choice).

* The player will have a limited amount of time to finish the quiz. 

  * The game ends when the time runs out. The page will reveal the number of questions that players answer correctly and incorrectly.

* Don't let the player pick more than one answer per question.

* Don't forget to include a countdown timer.

### Option Two: Advanced Assignment (Timed Questions)

![Advanced](Images/2-advanced.jpg)

**[Click Here to Watch the demo](https://youtu.be/xhmmiRmxQ8Q)**.

* You'll create a trivia game that shows only one question until the player answers it or their time runs out.

* If the player selects the correct answer, show a screen congratulating them for choosing the right option. After a few seconds, display the next question -- do this without user input.

* The scenario is similar for wrong answers and time-outs.

  * If the player runs out of time, tell the player that time's up and display the correct answer. Wait a few seconds, then show the next question.
  * If the player chooses the wrong answer, tell the player they selected the wrong option and then display the correct answer. Wait a few seconds, then show the next question.

* On the final screen, show the number of correct answers, incorrect answers, and an option to restart the game (without reloading the page).

### Reminder: Submission on BCS

* Please submit both the deployed Github.io link to your homework AND the link to the Github Repository!
